# Getting Started with MY FRAMEWORK JAVA WEB

## Introduction

MY FRAMEWORK JAVA WEB is a lightweight Java-based MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to simplify web application development by providing a structured approach to handling requests, views, and data flow.

## Installation

1. **Download**
    - Download the latest version of MY FRAMEWORK JAVA WEB from https://github.com/kenny516/FrameWork-Java-Web.git.

2. **Setup**
    - Include the MY FRAMEWORK JAVA WEB JAR file in your project's `WEB-INF/lib` directory.

3. **Configuration**

   Add the following configuration to your `web.xml` file to set up the front controller servlet:

   ```xml
   <!-- Configuration of the DispatcherServlet -->
   <servlet>
       <servlet-name>front_controller</servlet-name>
       <servlet-class>Controller.FrontController</servlet-class>
       <init-param>
           <param-name>controller</param-name>
           <param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/Controller</param-value>
       </init-param>
       <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
   </servlet>

   <!-- Mapping of URLs for the DispatcherServlet -->
   <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>front_controller</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
   ```

   Ensure that `Controller.FrontController` is the main entry point (`servlet-class`) for routing requests to your controllers.

## Creating Controllers

1. **Annotate Controllers**

   Annotate your controller classes with `@Controller` to identify them as part of your MVC architecture.

   ```java
   import your.package.Controller;

   @Controller
   public class MyController {
       // Controller methods
   }
   ```

2. **Define Routes**

   Use the `@Get` annotation on methods within your controllers to define routes for handling HTTP GET requests.

   ```java
   import your.package.Get;

   @Controller
   public class MyController {

       @Get("/users")
       public void getUsers() {
           // Logic to handle GET /users
       }

       @Get("/users/{id}")
       public void getUserById(@Param("id") int userId) {
           // Logic to handle GET /users/{id}
       }
   }
   ```

   Use `@Param` annotation to map URL path parameters to method parameters.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to define a controller and handle requests:

```java
import your.package.Controller;
import your.package.Get;
import your.package.Param;

@Controller
public class MyController {

    @Get("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    @Get("/user/{id}")
    public String getUserById(@Param("id") int userId) {
        // Retrieve user details based on userId
        return "User details for ID: " + userId;
    }
}
```

## Running Your Application

1. **Deploy**
    - Deploy your application to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.

2. **Access**
    - Access your application using the defined routes, e.g., `http://localhost:8080/yourapp/hello` for the `/hello` route defined in the example.

## Conclusion

MY FRAMEWORK JAVA WEB simplifies web development by providing a structured approach to routing and handling HTTP requests. With annotations like `@Controller`, `@Get`, and `@Param`, you can quickly define controllers and routes for your web application.
